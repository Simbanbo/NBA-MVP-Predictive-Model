The National Basketball Association (NBA) selects the Most Valuable Player (MVP) to reward the best performing player in each basketball season dating back to 1955. In the earlier eras, between 1955 and 1980, the award was voted by NBA players; however, since then, the award has been voted by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters in North America. There has been widespread debate and discussion on what “valuable” means in the regular season. For instance, is leading a team to the top of the conference standings have more significance in comparison to a superstar leading a poor team to the playoffs?

Basketball Analytics has revolutionized the game where NBA teams have deployed data analytics departments in the front office to help scout rookies, identify players that would improve rosters and other strategies / methods that can help build successful organization. The goal of this proejct is to leverage the extensive NBA data avaialble and develop a machine learning model to predict the 2022 NBA MVP winner. Additionally, we can determine if previous recipients of the award were undeserved and define key metrics / features that increase probability of winning the MVP award. With this proposed model, we could explore the top NBA players in each season and determine if the MVP projected winners are suitable trade candidates for a respective team.
